# Donate

I don't expect anyone to donate, but it is *extremely* appreciated. Most of the proceeds will go towards things like my Mullvad subscription or just other miscellaneous stuff that I want to buy. Again, I don't expect anyone to donate (I honestly don't know why you would, I don't do anything on here) but uh this page is here just in case.
